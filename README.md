# Steelyard

(A vaporware freeware browser game)

Making some notes here.

Tech wise I wanna look at using Cycle.js and SVG to do a game.
I think that'd be neat.

Game wise,
inpirations are
Sunless Sea,
Escape Velocity,
FTL,
Kerbal Space Program,
Elite,
Tradewars 2000,
Just Cause,
GTA.

## Explore and discover.
Manage resources, balanced against each other
IMO, this is where SS shines:
fragments get harder to accumulate as you strip mine the sea,
so you have to go farther,
balancing fuel, supplies and terror.
Terror + supplies vs. fuel: bigger engines, using the lamp.

## Change the world
Economic model
Farms, factories, markets.
Essentially invisible, but impacted by player actions.
e.g. if player delivers a lot and frequently of commodity X,
its price drops, and factories and markets for the commodity grow.
(Factory = linked market and farm)
Untraded or embargoed commodities drive prices up.
NPC ships spawn seeking various risk/reward routes.

Carry mail and news,
mail is on-behalf-of postal service
COD?
News is worth more father from source
sooner after collection.
Status associated with various ports carried by mail and news.
Player not the only one carrying, but do influence things.

Relationship between player and
the "how we do" aggregate...
(what would happen if the Dogs didn't show up)
Linked somehow to whatever distinguishes the player -
a priori, or how they play?
Maybe there's a standard difussion,
and trade rates remain stable by default,
but the player can transplant news/mail,
or exploit trade disparities until they fall.

Player actions influence faction reputation.
Possibly: player develops certain reps,
factions relate to those reps,
communicate their relationship to other factions,
who etc.
i.e. virtues and vice seen by others
(including player's crew)
are recognized,
and translated into opinions.
Player is Brave,
Fighties consider that Valor,
Peacniks hear Valor, think Warmonger.
Peacniks see Brave, think Hero of People,
which competes with them with Warmonger
etc and so on.

## Story modules
Very parameterized.
Challenge not to get chaotic,
but also want to avoid narrator's arrogance.
Some fiction,
some state machine-ness ~= choose your own adventure
Outcomes are single-shot boosts to game values.
Worth doing but don't dominate TCB.

Also, modules presented with motives
e.g.
- you should explore over there
- this is boringly stable
- something should happen because...
  (e.g. Peacniks and Fighties are actively antagonistic)

## Mechanical Transparency
There's something really interesting to SS's "unlocked with..."
that hints at possible costs and rewards.
On the one hand, easy for things to get too completely transparent
and become a big spreadsheet
On the other, very frustrating not to know what to do next
Some reliable way to discover the details of parts of the game would be nice.

## Procedural Generation
Enough that there's little point to a wiki in terms of cheats,
not so much that there's no point to sharing details and hints.
Thinking ports are determined,
their location is constrained but random
(and maybe progressive - determined JIT.)
Ports have features that make them conducive to
certain economic factors
(mountains = mines, plains = sheep)
and attractive to certain factions
Ownership becomes not just who's there,
but also who wishes they were,
and sets up those tensions.

Like story modules, maybe there are situation/port modules
so there's sometimes a joint ownership,
or two authorities at a port.
Or an active takeover.

A balance of sim and nar here:
the possibilities determined by what's already going on,
(and indeed, by what the player's been doing)
but then with a thumb on the scale for interest.
[a miracle occurs]

## Change the World as Goal
Goals should be broad and difficult and involve shifting economics and politics to get what you want.
e.g. Sauron is in the East,
here is Middle Earth and its peoples.
Go to.

## Your Ship
The moment to moment should be able successful navigation,
managing resources
Starting idea: cold lift fuel, supplies and terror from SS.
Damange to ship should be involved, and repair should be possible.
Consequences of damage should be interesting decision sources.
Damage should also work in concert -
leaking hull is one thing,
adding damanged bilge pump is quite another.
Finicky but hidden ship stats
(shipped tonnage vs. speed as impacted by shipped water)
help with that.
I.e. more stats give more parts for the ship to need
and to cope with when damaged.
Spare parts become a thing to carry.

Travel should be interesting
I think a KSP style space trader is a different game
but  the suprising and interesting variation in
mass,
fuel requirements,
duration of flight
are appealing.

One aspect where SS falls short is the simplicity of travel -
you pay tactical attention to travel
(lest you be eaten)
but strategically it's all "pick a vector."

One factor here would be the politics of the thing.
Sailing waters controlled by people who don't like you is going to be dangerous.
So there's a maze that shifts and changes as you influence the politics of the thing.
